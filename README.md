VAPT is a process in which we audit and exploit the available vulnerabilities of a network as well as website with respect to some global standards.  
  

Vulnerability Assessment : Its a process in which we only scan and look for the limitation or vulnerabilities of any website. it has nothing to do with the exploitation of the discovered vulnerabilities.  
 

Penetration testing : A process which deals in exploiting the available vulnerability report and make sure to discover the critical data of the website and later share the remedy for the same with the developers of the website.
